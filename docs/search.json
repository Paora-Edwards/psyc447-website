      "contents": "\r\nR Markdown\r\nThis is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.\r\nWhen you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\r\n\r\n\r\nsummary(cars)\r\n\r\n\r\n     speed           dist       \r\n Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  \r\n 1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  \r\n Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  \r\n Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  \r\n 3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  \r\n Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00  \r\n\r\nIncluding Plots\r\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
