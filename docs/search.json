I have experience in kaupapa Māori research gained through two summer research scholarships and my Honours project in Māori Studies. Both research scholarships were supervised by Professor Rāwinia Higgins for the Te Kura Roa project on community initiatives for the revitalisation of te reo Māori. My Honours project was supervised by Dr Awanui Te Huia, and involved interviews with heritage learners of te reo Māori on how they navigated experiences of whakamā within the language learning context.Statistical analysis with R. I have started to develop proficiency in conducting statistical analysis using R programming. My current research project involves a moderation analysis of the relationship between intergroup/intragroup discrimination and ethnic identity in Māori, as influenced by the level of prototypicality to the group category.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
