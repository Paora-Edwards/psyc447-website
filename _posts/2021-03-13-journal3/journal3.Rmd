Joe commented this week that some of the data visualisation techniques might be too easy for those of us who have experience in using R. However, I take this as a personal challenge to extend myself where I can. I noticed several formatting issues when completing the workbook assessment, so I have tried to address these with functions such as `str_wrap()` to prevent the plot titles from running off the page, or `scale_shape_manual()` to account for more than 6 classes in the scatterplot. I also set chunk options to prevent annoying default warning messages from appearing. I would have liked to increase the height of some of the plots using the `ggsave()` function but wasn't sure whether I needed to call the saved plot and how.

I assisted Cam with an unexpected result in Question 2. Whereas I had faceted my plot by year of manufacture, he had set the colour for each class of the `year` variable in an unfaceted plot. Although this would theoretically work, he found that the graph displayed a legend with a colour-continuum across 1998-2004 including years between. After we puzzled together, I thought perhaps the column had been set as numerical rather than as a factor which would account for the continuous colour-coding. Using `as.factor(year)` resolved the issue.
