I opted to write my report introduction using `Papaja`. I was largely successful at using the citation skills from the first assignment, however I was unable to seperate out the `R` package references from appearing in the reference list. I am unsure whether it is accepted APA practice to include technical references i.e. programmes in a separate list. For this reason it looks slightly messy!

I would like to better understand how to integrate tables and graphs within `Papaja`. Some of the preliminary data findings could have been better represented  in this way. However, I had difficulty using the `Kbl()` function as I had in my previous workbook. There must be `Papaja`-specific functions that enable these to work.
