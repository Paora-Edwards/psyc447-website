I have published my Distill website [here](https://paora-edwards.github.io/psyc447-website/docs/index.html)

At first I couldn't get the index webpage to update with changes. I later realised that I needed to update `_yml` file directly rather than `index.html`. I've found this Distill platform to be very easy to use.

I still don't quite get the different model equations for varying slopes and intercepts, and the difference between them. I'll hopefully work on this some more as I feel this is very useful for my intended moderation in my final report.
